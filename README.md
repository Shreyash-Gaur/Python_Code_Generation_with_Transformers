# Python Code Generation using Transformer Models

This repository contains a project that leverages Transformer models to generate Python code. The notebook demonstrates the steps involved in setting up the environment, preparing the dataset, training the model, and evaluating its performance in generating syntactically correct and semantically meaningful Python code snippets.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore the application of Transformer models, a state-of-the-art architecture in natural language processing, for the task of Python code generation. The goal is to train a model that can generate Python code given a natural language prompt or description. The project utilizes PyTorch and TorchText libraries for data handling, model building, and training.

### Key Features

- **Transformer Model Architecture:** Implements a Transformer model specifically for sequence-to-sequence tasks, optimized for Python code generation.
- **Custom Dataset Handling:** Prepares a dataset of Python code and corresponding descriptions, enabling effective training of the model.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Assesses the model's ability to generate accurate and functional Python code based on various evaluation metrics.

## What is a Transformer?

### Overview

Transformers are a class of deep learning models introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. (2017). They rely entirely on self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences, allowing them to handle dependencies across long distances more effectively than traditional models like RNNs or LSTMs. Transformers have since become the backbone of most modern NLP tasks, including language modeling, translation, summarization, and, as in this project, code generation.

### How the Transformer Works

1. **Self-Attention Mechanism:**
   - The core of the Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, which computes a weighted sum of input embeddings for each position in the sequence, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence as needed.
   
2. **Encoder-Decoder Architecture:**
   - The Transformer typically consists of an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder processes the input sequence and produces a context-rich representation. The decoder then generates the output sequence (in this case, Python code) based on the encoder's output and previous tokens in the sequence.
   
3. **Positional Encoding:**
   - Since Transformers do not have a built-in notion of sequence order, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to provide the model with information about the position of each token in the sequence.

4. **Training and Inference:**
   - During training, the model learns to minimize the difference between the generated sequence and the target sequence. In inference mode, the model generates code by predicting one token at a time, conditioned on the previously generated tokens.

## Repository Structure

- **`Python_Code_Generation_With_Transformers.ipynb`:** The main notebook containing the code for importing libraries, preparing the dataset, training the Transformer model, and evaluating its performance.
- **`data/`:** Directory where the processed dataset is stored.
- **`models/`:** Directory where trained models are saved.
- **`vocabulary/`:** Directory containing the generated vocabulary of the dataset.

## Steps in the Notebook

### 1. Importing Libraries

- **Libraries:** Essential libraries such as PyTorch, TorchText, Matplotlib, SpaCy, and others are imported to facilitate data handling, model building, training, and visualization.

### 2. Environment Setup

- **Device Configuration:** The code checks for GPU availability and sets the device to either CUDA (GPU) or CPU.

### 3. Dataset Preparation

- **Reading the Dataset:** The dataset containing Python code and corresponding descriptions is loaded.
- **Preprocessing:** The text data is tokenized, and appropriate data fields are defined for the input (descriptions) and output (code).
- **Batching and Iteration:** The dataset is split into batches and prepared for iteration during training.

### 4. Model Architecture

- **Transformer Implementation:** A custom Transformer model is implemented using PyTorch, tailored to the sequence-to-sequence nature of code generation.
- **Positional Encodings:** Positional encodings are added to the model to account for the order of tokens in the input sequences.

### 5. Training

- **Training Loop:** The model is trained over multiple epochs, with the loss being calculated and minimized using an optimizer.
- **Checkpointing:** Models are saved at regular intervals to allow the resumption of training or evaluation.

### 6. Evaluation and Code Generation

- **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on a validation set, and metrics such as accuracy is computed to assess its performance.
- **Code Generation:** Given a natural language prompt, the model generates Python code, which is then compared to the reference code.

### 7. Visualization

- **Plotting Results:** The notebook includes visualizations of attention maps to provide insights into the model's learning process.

## Future Work

- **Model Optimization:** Explore various hyperparameter settings and Transformer variants to improve the quality of generated code.
- **Dataset Expansion:** Incorporate more diverse and complex Python code snippets to enhance the model's generalization capabilities.
- **Advanced Evaluation Metrics:** Implement additional metrics such as BLEU or CodeBLEU, specifically designed to evaluate code generation tasks.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the potential of Transformer models in generating Python code based on natural language descriptions. By fine-tuning the model and experimenting with different configurations, the goal is to create a robust code generation system that can assist developers in automating code-writing tasks.
